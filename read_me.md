The purpose of this project is for strengthen my knowledge of the R Programming language and using that language to interact with data (in this case data in the form of a CSV) 

The spreadsheet TCA_2016.csv contains information about individual trips taken by a transportation company during 2016. 

Objective: 

1) analyze TCA_2016.csv to find which Run Id had the most trips in a single day and what was that date
2) create a graphic for total trips taken by each run ID for the year 
3) write a function that calls the Run ID and returns the most productive day and number of trips that date.
